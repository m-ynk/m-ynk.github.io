## Pwnable.kr FD challenge

Once you SSH in to the challenge username, the code of the challenge is
available.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
char buf[32];
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
	if(argc<2){
		printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");
		return 0;
	}
	int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
	int len = 0;
	len = read(fd, buf, 32);
	if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
		printf("good job :)\n");
		system("/bin/cat flag");
		exit(0);
	}
	printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
	return 0;

}
```

The program is quite straightforward. The program is reading 32 bytes from a file descriptor whose value is "attacker controlled".
If the input from that particular file descriptor is LETMEWIN then it just cats you the flag.

Since, **STDIN** is fd 0, so the special input is 4660 (0x1234).

Flag: __mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!__


## Site Note

One interesting thing to note that the challenges (as with other wargames) are implemented using the usual setuid binary trick.

Basically, the challenge executables can be executed by the unprivilaged user but are run as privilaged user. Hence, the program
upon successful compromise can read the flag.

Tip: Always check file ownership and permissions using `ls -l`.
